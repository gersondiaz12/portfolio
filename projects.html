								<h3>QuizLit</h3>
                                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/quizlit.png" alt="" /></span>
									
								<li> Designed and implemented an extensive login interface that accounted for form validation, error diagnostics, authentication indication models, and redirection logic and rendered in React Query. </li>

								<li> Designed the main dashboard page, including a responsive grid layout used in navigation, user statistic (streak tracker) area, quick-action cards, and dynamic navigation between the dashboard, study, profile and study set pages.</li>
                                
                                <li>Implemented large-scale profile functionalities, including renders of user profiles, editable descriptions with character restrictions, profile personalization, administrative features and contextual interaction menu.</li>

                                <li>Created dynamic, CSS-based layouts using current design trends, such as card based design, gradient styling, hover effects and mobile breakpoints in all executed pages.</li>
                                </p>

								<h3><i>The Searchers</i> Performance Study</h3>
                                <p>
								<li> Formulated a command line based user interface using C++, allowing for a user-friendly experience when comparing Jump Search and Interpolation Search algorithms. </li>

								<li>Applied UI elements to provide integral implementation of all project functions, involved dataset loading, generation and two search algorithms, to have an easy work of the user.</li>
                                
                                <li>Fixed all the main application logic to respond to a user input when using the Interpolation Search functionality and make sure that the algorithm is correctly called, and performance data is printed as a part of the comparison framework.</li>

								<h3>Minesweeper</h3>
                                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/minesweep.png" alt="" /></span>
								<li> Designed and implemented a fully functional Minesweeper game using C++ and SFML within the CLion IDE. </li>

								<li>Developed features including dynamic grid sizing, mine placement logic, timer, pause/resume functionality, and leaderboard tracking.</li>
                                
                                <li>Employed object-oriented design principles, modular code structure, and effective texture/sprite management for smooth gameplay and UI.</li>

                                <li>Integrated file I/O for configuration and leaderboard data persistence.</li>
                                </p>

                                <h3>Lizard Game</h3>
                                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/lizz.png" alt="" /><img src="images/blank.png" alt="" /><img src="images/blank.png" alt="" /></span>
								<li>Designed and developed an engaging grid-based game in Java, where players control a lizard navigating through a dynamically changing environment. Each lizard is modeled as a series of connected body segments, mimicking “snake-like” movement patterns.</li>

								<li>Engineered a robust grid management system within the LizardGame class, facilitating interactions between the lizard, walls, exits, and various other grid objects, enhancing game complexity and player engagement.</li>
                                
                                <li>Implemented comprehensive game mechanics, including lizard movement constrained by grid boundaries, collision detection with walls and exits, and responsive adjustments of the lizard’s body direction based on user input.</li>

                                <li>Incorporated listener-based event handling to update game states in real-time, managing score updates and triggering player notifications during key events (e.g., winning the game or colliding with obstacles).</li>

                                <li>Utilized JUnit for rigorous testing of game functionalities, ensuring reliable collision handling, accurate movement constraints, and seamless game flow.
                                </li>
